- CONCEPT (markdown cell explaining a concept)
- PRACTICE (code cell with example + exercise)
- CONCEPT (markdown cell explaining next concept) 
- PRACTICE (code cell with example + exercise)
- Continue alternating...

Guidelines:
- Skip package installation instructions - assume libraries are already installed
- Focus on practical, hands-on learning with immediate code examples
- Each concept should be concise and immediately followed by practice
- Code cells should include both examples AND exercises for the learner to try
- Use clear, educational comments in code
- Make exercises progressively build on previous concepts

Format the output as a valid JSON array of notebook cells. Each cell must have:
- "cell_type": "markdown" or "code"
- "source": array of strings (each line as a separate string)
- "metadata": {{"language": "markdown"}} for markdown cells or {{"language": "python"}} for code cells

For code cells, also include:
- "execution_count": null
- "outputs": []
